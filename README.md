## Why we call **Ascxz**?

>Firstly, I thought
>
>Mmm...I want a short domain, why not try something like abbreviation? Like this, **Munucial's high priority connection** -> **mhpc.com**
>But...
>As the researchs, all the 4-letters domain have been registered!!!
>So...
>I tried 5 letter, **Andrew's secured private communication zone** -> **aspcz.com**, yes perfect, but...**ascxz** types smoother (you know), although doesn't have meaning at all, but I like it :)
